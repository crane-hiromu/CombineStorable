# Storable

## Description

If you're using Combine, you've probably encountered the following code more than a few times.

```swift
class Object: NSObject {
    var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    ...
}
```

Instead of adding a new property to every object, use this library to add it for you, to any subclass of NSObject.

### Example1

```swift
final class Object: NSObject, Storable { // import Storable

    // You don't have to write this.
    // private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    func exec() {
        Just<Int>(0)
            .sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in
                // do something
            }, receiveValue: { _ in 
                // do something
            })
            .store(in: &self.cancellables) // read Set<AnyCancellable> in yourself.
    }
}
```

You can read ``Set<AnyCancellable>`` without member variable. It'll work just like a property: when the instance is deinit'd, the ``Set<AnyCancellable>`` gets disposed. It's also a readwrite property, so you can use your own, too.

Furthermore, ``.store(in: &self.cancellables)`` can be omitted.

### Example2


```swift
final class Object: NSObject, Storable {

    func exec() {
        Just<Int>(0)
            .sink(self, receiveCompletion: { _ in // input self
                // do something
            }, receiveValue: { _ in 
                // do something
            })
    }
}
```
