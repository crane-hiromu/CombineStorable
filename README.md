# Storable

## Description

If you're using Combine, you've probably encountered the following code more than a few times.

```
class Object: NSObject {
    var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    ...
}
```

Instead of adding a new property to every object, use this library to add it for you, to any subclass of NSObject.
